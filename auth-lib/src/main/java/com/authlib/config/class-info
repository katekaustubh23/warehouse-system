Filter interface in Java / Spring

The Filter interface is part of Servlet API (javax.servlet.Filter or jakarta.servlet.Filter).

It allows you to intercept HTTP requests and responses before they reach a servlet or after they leave it.

Key Points:

Purpose
Filters are used for cross-cutting concerns like:

Authentication/authorization ✅

Logging requests/responses ✅

Compression / encryption ✅

Adding headers ✅

Core Methods

public interface Filter {
    void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException; // called once on startup
    void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException; // called for every request
    void destroy(); // cleanup when server shuts down
}


doFilter() → main method: you can inspect or modify request/response, then pass control using:

chain.doFilter(request, response);

**How it fits in Spring Security**

OncePerRequestFilter and GenericFilterBean in Spring implement Filter.

Spring Security builds a filter chain: all security checks (JWT, CSRF, authentication) are filters.

Your JwtAuthenticationFilter is essentially a custom Filter that plugs into Spring’s filter chain.

✅ Summary:
A Filter is like a “gatekeeper” for HTTP requests/responses. It can intercept, check, modify, or block requests
before
they reach your controllers or servlets.
